  <objective>
    This workflow runs AFTER implementing fixes for review action items.
    It finds completed action items ([x]) with PR comment links, posts "Fixed" comments, and resolves the threads.
  </objective>

  <design-notes>
    **Why no commit SHA in responses:**
    - Gives operator flexibility about when to commit (before or after running this workflow)
    - Avoids issues when commits are amended (SHA changes, references become invalid)
    - The "Fixed" message is sufficient - reviewers can see the fix in the PR diff

    **Thread resolution:**
    - GitHub REST API does NOT support resolving review threads
    - Must use GraphQL API with `resolveReviewThread` mutation
    - Requires thread node ID (PRRT_...), not comment ID

Following .claude/README.md guidelines:
- Using /comments/COMMENT_ID/replies endpoint for threaded responses
- Posting "Fixed" confirmation
- Resolving threads via GraphQL API

Processing each comment...</output>

    <action>For EACH completed action item with PR link(s):
      1. Extract all comment_ids from PR comment URL(s)

      **If single PR comment (is_grouped == false):**
      2. Build full "Fixed" response (see template below)
      3. Post response to the comment thread
      4. Resolve the thread via GraphQL

      **If grouped PR comments (is_grouped == true):**
      2. Post FULL "Fixed" response to FIRST comment in the group
      3. Capture {{first_reply_url}} from response html_url field
      4. Resolve the first thread via GraphQL
      5. For EACH subsequent comment in the group:
         - Post SHORT reference response (see template below)
         - Resolve the thread via GraphQL
      6. Track all successes/failures

      **Full response template:**
      ```
      **FIXED**

      **Action item resolved:**
      - [x] [AI-Review][{{severity}}] {{description}} [{{file_reference}}]
      - Story file: {{story_file}}

      Changes implemented and verified.
      ```

      **Short reference template (for grouped comments after first):**
      ```
      **FIXED** - Related issue, resolved together with [this comment]({{first_reply_url}}).
      ```

      **Post reply using REST API:**
      `gh api -X POST repos/{{owner}}/{{repo}}/pulls/{{pr_number}}/comments/{{comment_id}}/replies -f body="{{response}}"`

      **Resolve thread using GraphQL API:**
      1. First, get the thread node ID for the comment:
         ```
         gh api graphql -f query='
           query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr: Int!) {
             repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
               pullRequest(number: $pr) {
                 reviewThreads(first: 100) {
                   nodes {
                     id
                     isResolved
                     comments(first: 1) {
                       nodes { databaseId }
                     }
                   }
                 }
               }
             }
           }
         ' -f owner='{{owner}}' -f repo='{{repo}}' -F pr={{pr_number}}
         ```
      2. Find the thread where comments.nodes[0].databaseId matches {{comment_id}}
      3. Resolve using the thread's node ID:
         ```
         gh api graphql -f query='
           mutation($threadId: ID!) {
             resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: $threadId}) {
               thread { isResolved }
             }
           }
         ' -f threadId='{{thread_node_id}}'
         ```

      Track success/failure for summary
    </action>
