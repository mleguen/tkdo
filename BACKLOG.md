# Future Work

## Features & Enhancements

### UI/UX Improvements

- Sort participants alphabetically
- Properly truncate participant names that are too long
- Separate PageOccasionComponent/OccasionComponent/ParticipantComponent following the model of PageIdeesComponent/ListeIdeesComponent/IdeeComponent

### Ideas & Comments Features

- Add to a participant's card the count of ideas proposed for them (only count readable ideas)
- Add the ability to comment on an idea by clicking on its card (only show own comments for own ideas)
- Display on an idea card the number of comments made (only count readable comments)
- Add the ability to cross out an idea when commenting on it (only show own cross-outs for own ideas)
- Add the ability to edit the title of an idea or a comment (for its author only)

### User Management

- Add the ability to disable a user account (still present in DB for history, but no longer usable)

### Admin Routes

- Add an admin route to cancel a draw
- Add an admin route to remove a user from an occasion
- Add an admin route to remove an exclusion
- Add an admin route to delete an occasion (if no draw or draw removed)

### Email Customization

- Make email signatures customizable to make them less "machine-like"

## Technical Improvements

### API enhancement

- switch to JSON+HAL, to decouple front and API: front would no longer have to build routes, or decide which actions are possible,
  as possible actions with their routes will already be provided with the state

### Dependencies & Security

- Upgrade Angular version (>= 20) to fix moderate vulnerabilities
- Make a PR in rpkamp/mailhog-client to fix deprecation "str_getcsv(): the $escape parameter must be provided as its default value will change"
- add a unique random slug to each entity, and use them in routes instead of ids to make it more difficult to forge routes
- Get rid of mhsendmail
- Upgrade to MySQL 8
- Implement a backup strategy

### Infrastructure & Deployment

- AWS serverless support with Ansible, and 2 dev/prod stacks
- Replace apache-pack with a proper build tool or remove it completely

### Code Quality & Database

- Rename fixtures to install, and provide a default admin email (the admin can then modify it themselves)
- Remove "doctrine" from auto-generated column names in database
